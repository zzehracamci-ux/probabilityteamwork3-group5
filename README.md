# probabilityteamwork3-group5
Project Title and Description
This project aims to experimentally verify the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN) and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) using computer simulations3. It also includes a practical application of SLLN through Monte Carlo $\pi$ Estimation. The project demonstrates how random variables behave at scale and how they converge to theoretical values.

Project Structure
The repository follows the required exact folder structure:
src/: Contains the Java source code files for all simulations (SLLN, CLT, and Monte Carlo).
results/figures/: Stores all generated plots, including histograms, Q-Q plots, and convergence graphs in PNG/PDF format.
reports/: Contains the technical reports documenting the findings and observations of the project.
data/: (Optional) Directory for any generated datasets or raw simulation outputs.
README.md: Provides project description, team information, and instructions.
